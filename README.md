3 approaches have been used to achieve blanket coverage namely, Jelly-fish Swarm Optimization(jso), Q-learning(qlearning_func) and Virtual Force Approach(vfa_code). Each approach has been written as a separate function which will be called by run_all. Simply run the 'run_all' file. You will get 2 graphs, one of coverage and one of number of iterations for convergence. The code may take ~5 min to complete running.
